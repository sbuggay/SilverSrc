# silversrc
The Quake 1/2 engine written from scratch using SDL2/OpenGL/OpenAL.

Although this engine is designed to work with Quake 1 .PAK files, those files are not a part of this repository. You must acquire those though purchase of the game.

#### Future plans
- Add Vulkan support
- Support more versions of wad/pak (currently only supports wad 0x17)
